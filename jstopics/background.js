hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the application RadiaCode it is possible to display on the graph not only the spectrum of accumulated emission, but also to compare the spectrum with the previously measured background spectrum. One can display spectrum and background graphs at the same time in the overlay mode, or display a graph of the difference between the values ​​of the current spectrum and the background.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">To use a background, you first need to measure this background with the device over a period of time. Then you need to save the resulting spectrum to the spectrum library. To do this, tap the local menu call button in the spectrum window: <img alt=\"SpectrumLocalMenu\" style=\"margin:0;width:2.7500rem;height:2.1875rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/spectrumlocalmenu.png\"\/><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Select “Save Spectrum to Library” from the dropdown menu. You will be prompted to name the spectrum. The spectrum will be displayed with this name in the library list. If you leave the “Set as Current Background” option enabled, then after saving the spectrum will be displayed on the graph as a background. You can also select the background from the spectra library in future.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">There are two modes for displaying spectrum and background. In the overlay mode, the background graph is drawn on top of the spectrum graph - the spectrum is drawn in orange, the background in green. In the second mode, the difference between the spectrum and the background is displayed, the color of the graph is purple.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the mode of displaying the difference between the spectrum and the background, the difference in the count rate is displayed, since the background and the current spectrum always have different accumulation times and it makes no sense to subtract the number of accumulated pulses.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"color: #903c39;\">If using spectrum and background from different devices for superposition RadiaCode-10X, it should be borne in mind that different devices have different calibration factors. When overlaying spectra graphs, the application compares them per channel (the first channel with the first channel, the second channel with the second channel, etc.). Different devices have different emission energies corresponding to the same spectral channels, therefore, when the graphs from different devices are superimposed, differences in the positions of the peaks corresponding to the same emission energy will appear.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the application detects such a situation, it issues an appropriate warning. Device RadiaCode-10X is identified by its serial number.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_SubTitle\"><span class=\"f_SubTitle\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
