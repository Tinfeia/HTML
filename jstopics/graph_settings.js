Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The &quot;Graph line thickness&quot; option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the line thickness of the main graphs.

The blue zone shows the boundaries where the rate value was in the given time interval. If you select &quot;Last .... minutes&quot; option, the blue zone boundaries are updated every minute. If the real-time dose rate\/count rate value coming from the device exceeds the current limits, the limits are updated according to the current value.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The indicator bar shows:<\/span> Select which value the indicator displays - dose rate or count rate.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Labels on graphs:<\/span> You can choose where the values of the measured values, together with the units of measurement and the error, will be located on the graphs - on the right or on the left.
