hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">The radiation hardness graph makes it possible at any time to estimate which energies predominate in the gamma-ray spectrum (low, medium, high). The application has a built-in table of hardness coefficients of reference values from ionizing radiation sources. Thanks to this table, it is possible to tell which isotope best corresponds to a particular hardness value. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The determination of isotopes is conditional. If, for example, the application has determined that the radiation hardness corresponds to the reference radiation hardness from, for example, caesium-137, then this only gives reason to assume that the radiation hardness is the same as that of the reference source of caesium-137. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Also, pseudo-determination of isotopes will not work if there are several radionuclides in the sample or gamma field.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the graph settings, you can choose which isotopes from the table will participate in the pseudo-determination, and which will not. This allows you to disable the display of rare isotopes to reduce the likelihood of incorrect determination.<\/p>\n\r"
