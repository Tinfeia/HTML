hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the libraries of spectra, spectrograms, tracks and device profiles, you can place the contents in folders, just like in the file system. No folders are physically created on the smartphone and all folder information is in the application database file. File names must be unique within the entire library - the application will not let you save a file with an existing name, even if the existing file is in a different folder.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The interface associated with folders is the same in all the libraries listed, although the composition of the drop-down menus may vary slightly depending on the type of library. To create a folder, select the appropriate option from the toolbar\'s options menu:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><img alt=\"_create_folder\" style=\"margin:0;width:22.5000rem;height:28.3125rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/_create_folder.png\"\/><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">In the list, folders are always displayed before files. Touching a folder takes you to that folder. If the screen does not show the root folder, you can move up a level by touching the very first line with the arrow icon, as well as the &quot;Back&quot; button on your smartphone.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">To move a file to a folder, tap it and choose &quot;Move to Folder&quot; from the drop-down menu:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><img alt=\"_move_to_folder\" style=\"margin:0;width:22.5000rem;height:33.8750rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/_move_to_folder.png\"\/><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">At the bottom of the screen you will see a panel with explanatory text and buttons:<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><img alt=\"_move_here\" style=\"margin:0;width:22.5000rem;height:6.0000rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/_move_here.png\"\/><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Navigating between folders, select the desired folder and click &quot;Move Here&quot;.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">To rename, delete or mark a folder, make a long tap on it and select an action from the drop-down menu. You can select multiple files and\/or folders to move at the same time. The menu for actions with the marked files\/folders is called &quot;options menu&quot; by touching the three-dot icon in the upper right corner of the screen.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">It is possible to display all library files as a single list, so that you can see the entire contents of the library at a glance. To do this, select &quot;Simple list without folders&quot; from the options menu. In simple list mode, for each file, the path to its folder is displayed if the file is not in the root folder. To display the folders again, select &quot;Show Folders&quot; from the options menu.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Imported spectra, spectrograms and tracks go to the root folder.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
