The <img alt=\"ic_flip_camera\" style=\"margin:0;width:1.5000rem;height:1.5000rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/ic_flip_camera.png\"\/> button in camera mode also allows you to switch cameras.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Flash<\/span>: Selects the flash mode - auto\/on\/off. The <img alt=\"ic_flash_auto\" style=\"margin:0;width:1.5000rem;height:1.5000rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/ic_flash_auto.png\"\/> button in camera mode also allows you to select the flash mode.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Aspect Ratio<\/span>: Select the aspect ratio of the photo. Most photosensitive sensors installed in smartphones have an aspect ratio of 4:3, and choosing a ratio of 16:9 simply crops the image at the edges.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Image resolution<\/span>: You can select the photo resolution. By default, if you let the system choose, it will set the maximum possible resolution and the photos will take up quite a lot of space. It is recommended to select a photo resolution close to the smartphone screen resolution to minimize scaling artifacts. The list of resolutions when choosing a custom resolution is provided by the system; the application uses it as is, so there may be some discrepancies between the preview image and the photo, which are related to the different aspect ratios of the photo and preview, as well as the resolution selected in the list. The fourth factor is the screen orientation, which can also affect the appearance of the final photo.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Image quality<\/span>: The compression quality of the jpeg format in which the photos are saved.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Image watermarks:<\/span> Watermarks that are superimposed at the bottom of the photo. The Google Geocoder service is used to determine the address. The information provided by this service may be inaccurate, unreliable, or absent altogether. The slider in the group adjusts the transparency of the captions.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Options - Shutter Sound<\/span>: Play a system sound that simulates the shutter of a mechanical camera when shooting.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Options - Preview resolution same as photo<\/span>: Try to set the preview window to the same resolution as the photo - see Image resolution above. In this case, the preview image will look approximately the same as the photo.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Options - Map auto-centering when recording a track<\/span>: By default, when shooting from the map mode, the overlay displays the section of the map that was active when the camera was called up, and the map in the overlay window remains motionless. If you enable this option, the map in the overlay window will automatically move every 10 seconds in accordance with the current coordinates of the smartphone.<\/p>\n\r"
