Averaging is necessary to reduce the range of fluctuations of the arrows and the boundaries of the statistical zones on the indicators. Averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean for the specified time interval. If you specify an interval equal to zero, then averaging will not be performed. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The graphs display the operational data &quot;as is&quot;, without averaging.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Average value graphs<\/span>: These graphs display the values of quantities averaged over several neighboring counts. Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">The &quot;Graph line thickness&quot; option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the thickness of the outline lines of the main (gray) graphs.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Y-Axis Scale:<\/span> selection between linear, logarithmic and square root scales.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Y-axis zoom mode:<\/span> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Across the entire range:<\/span> minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated over the entire range of data.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">By visible area:<\/span> minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated from the plot of data shown on the graph. <\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stroke graphs:<\/span> If you disable this option, the application will not outline the graphs with a bright line.<\/p>\n\r"
